This is the copy for a landing page I need to create: 
"FULL VSL LANDING PAGE COPY

HERO SECTION (ABOVE THE FOLD)
Your DTC channel should be a machine by now.
Instead, it is still not moving at the pace you want and it is probably costing you more than you realize.
[ Embedded VSL video ]
Customers like your product.  You are spending aggressively.  But CAC keeps rising, repeat rate is flat, and every agency call sounds the same.
We are Roy and Allan, founders who scaled a DTC brand from $0 to $3M+ in 2 years, shipped to 120 countries, built our own e-commerce software, and now work with founders who want their growth engine to actually work.
We are not an agency.  We are founders who work with founders.
Book a 15-minute call No pitch. Just a conversation about where you are stuck.

SOCIAL PROOF STRIP
Featured in and worked with:
Breitling, Nestlé, Mercedes-Benz, Luminox, Forbes, Rolling Stone, TEDx, NASDAQ Tower

DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?
Most 7-figure founders we speak to recognize this instantly:
* You are paying $10K to $20K+ per month to agencies and still translating their reports yourself 
* Every miss is blamed on testing or the algorithm 
* Customers buy once, leave great reviews, then disappear 
* CAC is up, margins are tight, LTV is flat 
* AI is everywhere, but no one can clearly tell you what matters for your size 
* International expansion has been next quarter for over a year 
* You do not have time for another course and need answers now 
This is not because you are doing something wrong.
It is because no one is challenging the system you are operating in.

FOUNDERS FOR FOUNDERS
We are not an agency.  We do not bill hours.  We do not sell retainers.
We are founders who have built and scaled DTC brands ourselves and now work alongside a small number of founders who want to do the same.
Think of us as the sparring partner you do not have:
* Already made the expensive mistakes 
* Knows what is working right now because we are still in the game 
* Challenges assumptions before they cost six months and six figures 
Your agencies want to keep the account.  Your team does not want to rock the boat.  Your peers are being polite.
We do not have those incentives.

WHAT WORKING TOGETHER ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE
We do not just answer questions.  We challenge the questions you are asking.
Here is what founders get when working with us:
* Clarity on priorities  You have 47 things on your list. We identify the 3 that actually move the needle. 
* Strategy stress testing  We poke holes in assumptions and call out bad ideas before they get expensive. 
* Agency accountability  Know exactly what to ask, how to read reports, and when to push or walk away. 
* Real benchmarks  Not outdated industry averages. Actual data from brands operating today. 
* AI without the noise  What to use, how to configure it, and what to ignore. 
* Frameworks and templates  Copy and paste ready. The same playbooks we use ourselves. 
* International expansion support  Logistics, pricing, taxes, partners. We shipped to 120 countries in year one. 
Book a 15-minute call  See if this makes sense for where you are right now.

WHY US
We have done this ourselves.
* TBô: $0 to $3M+ in two years 
* 400,000+ customers 
* 40%+ repeat rate compared to an 11% industry average 
* 120+ countries shipped to in year one 
When the tools did not exist, we built them.  That became Decommerce.
Today, we advise founder-led brands and global operators who do not need basic advice. They need clear thinking and leverage.
We have hired and fired agencies.  Worked with Meta, Google, and TikTok.  Tested hundreds of tools and vendors.
So when someone pitches you something, we can tell you if it is worth it.

HOW THE ENGAGEMENT WORKS
This is not a course.  It is a coaching partnership.
* Two strategy calls per month focused on what is most urgent 
* Direct Slack access for real-time questions 
* Frameworks, tools, and benchmarks relevant to your stage 
* Agency sparring before and after key calls 
There is a 3-month minimum.  This is about building an engine, not applying a quick fix.

THE ENGAGEMENT OPTIONS
We work with a small number of founders at a time.  This is not a program you join. It is a partnership we agree to.
OPTION 1
DTC COMMAND CENTER
Ongoing Coaching Partnership
$4,500 per month  3-month minimum commitment
Includes:
* Two 60-minute strategy calls per month 
* Direct Slack access for async questions

* Proven frameworks, templates, and tools 
* Real benchmarks from brands at your stage 
Best for founders who want a long-term sparring partner while continuing to operate their business.

OPTION 2
FOUNDER ACCELERATOR
90-Day Intensive
$10,000 one-time

* 90-day engagement

* Full Slack access during the engagement 
Best for founders who want concentrated momentum and a clear operating plan for the next phase.

IMPORTANT NOTES
* We do not offer hourly billing 
* We do not execute work for you 
* We do not work with more than a small number of brands at once 
The value comes from clarity, pressure testing, and better decisions.

WHAT FOUNDERS SAY
We work with a small number of founder-led brands. Here is what they tell us.
“This was the first time someone actually challenged our thinking instead of validating it. Within weeks, we killed initiatives that were wasting time and doubled down on what moved revenue.”  Founder, DTC Brand
“We finally understood what our agencies were doing and more importantly what they were not doing. The clarity alone paid for itself.”  CEO, International DTC Brand
“It feels less like coaching and more like having a co-founder who has already made the mistakes we were about to make.”  Founder, Luxury Consumer Brand
“The biggest value was focus. We stopped reacting and started sequencing.”  Founder, Multi-country DTC Brand

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Is this an agency or consulting service?
No. We do not execute campaigns or manage channels.  We work as strategic sparring partners.

Will you replace our existing agencies?
Usually no. We help founders get more value from existing agencies or decide confidently when it is time to change them.

Is this done for you?
No. We guide and challenge. You and your team execute.

How is this different from a course or mastermind?
There is no curriculum. Everything is applied to your specific business and numbers.

How much time does this require?
Two strategy calls per month plus async questions as needed.

What happens on the 15-minute call?
We discuss where you are stuck and whether working together makes sense.  If it does not, we will tell you.

Do you work with every brand that applies?
No. We only work with founders where we believe we can create meaningful leverage.

FINAL CTA
Ready to stop guessing?
15 minutes. No pitch.  Just a conversation about where you are stuck and whether we can help.

What's included:

The page follows your brand guidelines with the purple-to-cyan gradient theme in light mode. All 11 sections from your copy are built out with conversion-optimized design patterns: sticky header with CTA, hero section with VSL video player (clicking the play button opens your Google Drive video in a new tab), social proof strip with logo placeholders ready for your brand images, problem/agitation section, founders credibility section, benefits grid, impressive stats section, engagement details, dual pricing cards highlighting the "Most Popular" option, testimonial cards, FAQ grid, and a strong final CTA.

Could you try uploading it one more time using the attachment/paperclip button? If that doesn't work, another option would be to host the PNG somewhere (like on your website or a service like imgur) and give me the URL - I could then reference it directly in the HTML.

In the meantime, let me try to improve the SVG to better match your image - I can see it has a woman's profile with flowing hair in green (

replace the logo that is in the green square with the breitling logo attached to this message

I can see you want to replace that small Luminox logo (in the green square) with the Breitling logo. Let me check for the uploaded file and make that replacement:


View steps
The Breitling logo you shared is showing in the chat but wasn't uploaded as a file. Could you please upload the Breitling logo file using the attachment button?

In the meantime, I can see from your screenshot that there's a duplicate - you have both a small "LUMI NOX" icon AND a larger "Luminox" logo with text. Looking at your current logos, I see there's luminox.avif being used.

Let me check the current HTML to see what's happening:


View steps
I see the issue - the small "LUMI NOX" icon in the green square is coming from luminox.avif. But looking at your screenshot, there's ALSO a larger "Luminox" logo with text appearing - that must be from the Louis XVI SVG file showing incorrectly.

Please upload the Breitling logo file (drag and drop or use the paperclip) and I'll replace that small Luminox icon with Breitling.

On mobile it doesn't look super responsive

You're right, the mobile view needs work. I can see from your screenshot that the header logo and button are cramped, and the overall layout needs better mobile optimization. Let me fix the responsive styles:


View steps
I've significantly improved the mobile responsiveness with:

Header: Smaller logo and compact CTA button that won't overlap
Typography: Better scaling for headings and body text on small screens
Hero section: Reduced padding, smaller video player
Logos: Properly sized for mobile (28px height on very small screens)
Stats grid: Tighter spacing with smaller numbers
Pricing cards: Reduced padding and font sizes
CTAs: Full-width buttons on mobile for easier tapping
All sections: Reduced padding and better spacing throughout

let's add this video https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GhqJOBPjCJ-cWorjCS0vcZ_jz9wB_sqk/view?usp=sharing

I see the video link is already set up in the landing page to open that Google Drive link when clicked. However, Google Drive links don't embed well directly. For a better user experience, I'd recommend either:

Keep as-is: Clicking the play button opens the video in a new tab (current setup)
Embed properly: Upload the video to Vimeo, Wistia, or YouTube for proper embedding
Let me verify the current video link is correct:


View steps
The video link is already set up correctly. When users click the play button, it opens your Google Drive video in a new tab.

Would you like me to:

Add a video thumbnail image - If you have a thumbnail/screenshot from the video, upload it and I'll add it as the background
Change to an embedded player - If you upload the video to YouTube, Vimeo, or Wistia, I can embed it directly so it plays on the page
Let me know which option you prefer!

I'm uploading it to youtube... I'll let you knwo when it's ready....

Sounds good! Let me know once it's uploaded to YouTube and share the link - I'll embed it properly so visitors can watch the video directly on the page without leaving. YouTube embeds work much better than Google Drive links for this purpose.

Here's a description optimized for YouTube that supports your landing page:

Your DTC channel should be a machine by now.

If you're a 7-figure DTC founder spending $10K-$20K+/month on agencies but still:

Translating their reports yourself
Watching CAC rise while LTV stays flat
Hearing "it's the algorithm" every time something misses
...this video is for you.

We're Roy and Allan — founders who scaled TBô from $0 to $3M+ in 2 years, shipped to 120+ countries, and built our own e-commerce software (Decommerce).

We're not an agency. We're founders who work with founders.

In this video, we share what's actually working in DTC right now — and why most founders are stuck in the same loops.

What title should I use?

For the YouTube video title, I'd recommend one of these options:

Option 1 (Direct, matches landing page):

Your DTC channel should be a machine by now.

Option 2 (More curiosity-driven):

Why Your DTC Brand Is Stuck (And What Actually Works in 2026)

Option 3 (Problem-focused):

Spending $10K+/mo on Agencies? Here's What They Won't Tell You

Option 4 (Authority-based):

$0 to $3M DTC Brand: What We Learned Scaling to 120 Countries

I'd go with Option 1 since it matches your landing page headline exactly - this creates consistency when visitors click through from YouTube to your site. It's also intriguing enough to generate clicks.

View steps
Let me update the video section with a fallback approach - a clickable thumbnail that opens YouTube if the embed doesn't work:

I've simplified the embed code. However, the "Error 153 - Video player configuration error" typically means one of these issues:

Video is set to Private - Go to YouTube Studio → Your video → Visibility → Change to "Public" or "Unlisted"
Embedding is disabled - Go to YouTube Studio → Your video → Show more → Check "Allow embedding"
Video is still processing - Wait a few more minutes for YouTube to finish processing
To fix this:

Go to YouTube Studio
Click on your video "Your DTC channel should be a machine by now"
Check that visibility is Public or Unlisted
Scroll down to "Show more" and make sure "Allow embedding" is checked
Save changes
Once you've done that, refresh the landing page and it should work!

"Unlisted" should work for embedding. The issue might be that "Allow embedding" is disabled.

Look for "Allow embedding" checkbox - make sure it's checked
Save
Alternatively, since the file is now showing in the system, let me also try using the standard YouTube embed URL format:

it is allowed

I can see "Allow embedding" is checked, which is good. The issue might be that you're viewing the HTML file locally (from a file:// path). YouTube embeds often don't work when opened as local files due to security restrictions.

The embed should work fine once the page is hosted on a real web server (like when you deploy it to your website).

To test it now, you can either:

Test on a simple local server - If you have Python installed, run this in the folder with your HTML file:
   python -m http.server 8000
Then open http://localhost:8000/decommerce-landing-page.html

Deploy it to your website - Once it's on a real domain (like decommerce.com), the YouTube embed will work properly.
The embed code is correct - this is just a local file restriction. Would you like me to make any other changes to the landing page while you prepare to deploy it?

Done! I've added the Meta Pixel Lead event to all 6 CTA buttons. Now whenever someone clicks any "Book a Call" button, it will fire a Lead event that you can track in Meta Ads Manager.

Is there anything else you'd like to add before deploying?

Can we also have a popup to colelct email address in case they are trying to leav eht epage ?

We can ask them to join our monthly newsletter where we share our findings, best AI tools.... write a nice copy. We can save the emails, first name, last name in this google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IkdCWzMDqTQ8N6yWjy8pwjvst7B-TOl5FSIhMkAYHKk/edit?usp=sharing

I'll add an exit-intent popup with a newsletter signup that saves to your Google Sheet. To connect to Google Sheets, we'll need to use a Google Apps Script web app as a middleman.


1 step
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me go through the conversation chronologically to capture all the important details:

**Initial Request**: User wants to create a VSL landing page for DTC founder coaching. They provided:
Full copy for the landing page
Brand guidelines (Decommerce branding with purple, cyan, magenta colors)
Video link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GhqJOBPjCJ-cWorjCS0vcZ_jz9wB_sqk/view
Light mode theme preference

**Clarifying Questions**: I asked about format (HTML), CTA destination (Calendly), video embed (thumbnail + play button), and logos (user will provide).

**HTML Creation**: Created comprehensive landing page at /Users/allan/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/1bb367f9-7d66-45c8-b7f0-017df6f9e6b9/04f3f460-3f56-4b56-809c-68d745abbb28/local_2b59e813-acd8-406c-8d6a-ab307a67186d/outputs/decommerce-landing-page.html with all sections from the copy.

**Calendly Link Update**: Replaced placeholder with actual link: https://calendly.com/roy-bernheim-decommerce/meeting-15-minutes

**Logo Updates**: Multiple iterations:
Added initial logos (Mercedes-Benz, Luminox, Jägermeister, Louis XVI, Thalia, SIHF)
User complained logos were too small - increased from 32px to 48px, removed grayscale filter
Replaced Louis XVI logo with new version
Replaced Thalia logo - user had to upload official SVG file (Thalia_Logo_NEU_2025.svg)
Replaced Mercedes-Benz with official SVG
Replaced Louis XVI with official SVG (199094.svg which was actually the Luminox logo that became Louis XVI)
Replaced small Luminox icon with Breitling logo (Logo_Breitling_2018_1884_P.png)

**Decommerce Logo**: Replaced placeholder SVG with actual logo (logos/decommerce.png)

**Mobile Responsiveness Issues**:
Header button too large on mobile - reduced multiple times
Logo too big on mobile - reduced from 32px to 28px to 24px
Button still stretching full width - added width: auto !important and flex-shrink: 0
Made header sticky only on scroll up (hide on scroll down, show on scroll up)

**YouTube Video Embedding**:
Initial Google Drive link
User uploaded to YouTube: https://youtu.be/GF-jh4vQZYs
Error 153 - player configuration error
Tried different embed formats
Issue was likely local file restrictions - will work when deployed

**Founder Photos Collage**:
User uploaded 6 photos to /sessions/amazing-relaxed-fermi/mnt/outputs/images/
Created CSS grid collage layout
User wanted Palais Federal photo as main - had to identify correct file (20251219_143445.jpg)

**Meta Pixel Tracking**:
Added pixel ID 2216076458592536
Added PageView tracking
Added Lead event on all CTA button clicks

**Current Request**: User wants exit-intent popup for newsletter signup:
Collect: email, first name, last name
Save to Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IkdCWzMDqTQ8N6yWjy8pwjvst7B-TOl5FSIhMkAYHKk/edit?usp=sharing
Nice copy about monthly newsletter with findings and AI tools

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user requested a high-converting VSL landing page for DTC founder coaching services (Decommerce). The page needed to:
   - Follow Decommerce brand guidelines (purple 
#9023F3, cyan

#C534B5, light mode)
   - Include all sections from provided copy (Hero, Social Proof, Problem, Founders, Benefits, Why Us, How It Works, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, Final CTA)
   - Be fully responsive for mobile and desktop
   - Embed a YouTube video
   - Include brand logos, founder photo collage
   - Have Meta Pixel tracking with Lead events on CTA clicks
   - Have an exit-intent popup for newsletter signup (PENDING)

Key Technical Concepts:
Responsive HTML/CSS landing page design
CSS Grid for photo collage and logo layouts
YouTube iframe embedding
Meta Pixel integration (fbq tracking)

Errors and Fixes:
**Logos too small**: User said "this look like shit... the logos are super small" - Increased height from 32px to 48px, removed grayscale filter, increased opacity
**Wrong Thalia logo**: SVG I created didn't match - User uploaded official Thalia_Logo_NEU_2025.svg
**Header button too wide on mobile**: User said "still the too wide... the button is taking the whole width" - Added width: auto !important, max-width: none !important, flex-shrink: 0 to header button styles
**YouTube Error 153**: "Video player configuration error" - Tried multiple embed formats; issue is that embedding doesn't work from local file:// paths due to security restrictions. Will work when deployed to a real server.
**Wrong main photo in collage**: User pointed out beach photo was showing as main instead of Palais Federal - Had to read image files to identify correct one (20251219_143445.jpg)

Problem Solving:
Solved responsive header issues with specific CSS targeting .header .btn-small
Implemented scroll-direction-aware sticky header using JavaScript with requestAnimationFrame
Created photo collage using CSS Grid with grid-column and grid-row spanning
YouTube embed issue remains (works on deployed server, not local files)

I had just started reading the HTML file to find the right location to add the exit-intent popup code when the summary was requested.

Optional Next Step:
Continue implementing the exit-intent popup by:
1. Adding CSS styles for the popup modal
2. Adding HTML for the popup form (first name, last name, email fields)
3. Writing compelling newsletter copy
4. Adding JavaScript for exit-intent detection (mouseleave event on document)
5. Creating Google Apps Script web app to receive form data and write to the Google Sheet
6. Providing instructions to user for setting up the Google Apps Script

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /sessions/amazing-relaxed-fermi/mnt/.claude/projects/-sessions-amazing-relaxed-fermi/f773ef3e-6136-45cb-a319-ea6288b95aef.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

I'll continue implementing the exit-intent popup for newsletter signup. Let me first read the current HTML file to find the right location to add the popup code.


View steps
Now I have the full HTML file. I'll add the exit-intent popup with a compelling newsletter signup form. I need to:

Add CSS styles for the popup modal
Add HTML for the popup form (first name, last name, email)
Write compelling newsletter copy
Add JavaScript for exit-intent detection
Create the form submission logic for Google Sheets

View steps
Now let me add the popup HTML before the closing body tag:


View steps
Now let me add the JavaScript for exit-intent detection and form submission at the end of the script section:


View steps
The exit-intent popup is now added to the landing page. Now I need to provide you with the Google Apps Script code that you'll need to deploy to connect the form to your Google Sheet. Let me create that script for you:


View steps
I've added the exit-intent popup to your landing page. Here's a summary of what's been implemented:

Exit-Intent Popup Features:

Triggers when the user's mouse leaves the browser window (on desktop) or scrolls back up significantly (on mobile)
Collects first name, last name, and email
Clean, on-brand design matching your landing page aesthetic
Smooth animations and transitions
Closes via X button, clicking outside, or pressing Escape
Won't show again in the same session if dismissed
Won't show again at all if they've already submitted
Newsletter Copy:

"Wait—before you go. Every month, we share what's actually working in DTC right now. The AI tools worth using. The strategies driving results. The mistakes to avoid."

To complete the Google Sheets integration, you need to:

Open your Google Sheet
Go to Extensions → Apps Script
Paste the code from the google-apps-script.js file I created
Deploy as a Web App (access: "Anyone")
Copy the deployment URL and replace YOUR_SCRIPT_ID in the HTML
View your landing page

Now let me check if there are any remaining em dashes in the file:

How should we go about to deploy the page and the script?

Great question! Here's how to deploy both:

For the Google Apps Script (do this first):

Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IkdCWzMDqTQ8N6yWjy8pwjvst7B-TOl5FSIhMkAYHKk/edit
Go to Extensions → Apps Script
Delete any existing code and paste the script from the google-apps-script.js file
Click Deploy → New deployment
Select Web app as the type
Set "Execute as" to Me and "Who has access" to Anyone
Click Deploy and copy the URL it gives you
Then update the landing page with that URL (replace YOUR_SCRIPT_ID in the JavaScript).

For the landing page, you have a few options:

Where would you like to host the landing page?
[No preference]
No worries, I'll give you the simplest approach using Vercel since it's free and takes about 2 minutes:

Deploy to Vercel (easiest method):

Go to vercel.com and sign up (free)
Once logged in, drag and drop your entire outputs folder (which contains the HTML, logos, and images) onto the Vercel dashboard
Vercel will automatically deploy it and give you a URL like your-project.vercel.app
You can connect a custom domain later if you want (like coaching.decommerce.com)
Before deploying, make sure to:

First deploy the Google Apps Script and get the URL
Update the landing page with that URL
Then deploy to Vercel
Would you like me to help you set up the Google Apps Script first? I can walk you through it step by step, or if you give me access to deploy it differently, let me know what you prefer.

https://script.google.com/a/macros/decommerce.com/s/AKfycbxk-l44fPEXfXUgR2qttY913MqNIS1WKUSIo1b5F_8v_bj0TaaE6MeE1YDsWk10kXESTA/exec

deployment ID AKfycbxk-l44fPEXfXUgR2qttY913MqNIS1WKUSIo1b5F_8v_bj0TaaE6MeE1YDsWk10kXESTA

This is th escript

I'll update the landing page with your Google Apps Script URL.


View steps
Done! The Google Apps Script URL is now connected.

Now for deploying the landing page to Vercel:

Go to vercel.com and sign in (or create a free account)
Click "Add New..." → "Project"
Choose "Deploy without Git" (or drag & drop)
Upload your outputs folder contents (the HTML file, logos folder, and images folder)
Vercel will give you a live URL instantly
Alternatively, if you want me to help you set up a GitHub repo and connect it to Vercel for easier updates in the future, let me know. That way any changes you make can be pushed and auto-deployed.

View your landing page (ready to deploy)

Decommerce landing page
Code · HTML 
Will I be able to have a custom domain with a free vercel account?

Yes! Vercel's free tier includes custom domain support. You can connect any domain you own (like coaching.decommerce.com or dtc.decommerce.com) at no extra cost.

To set it up:

Deploy your site to Vercel first
Go to your project settings → Domains
Add your custom domain (e.g., coaching.decommerce.com)
Vercel will give you DNS settings to add to your domain registrar
If using a subdomain, you'll add a CNAME record pointing to cname.vercel-dns.com
Vercel also provides free SSL certificates automatically, so your site will be HTTPS from the start.

But first lets add it into my github

Great idea! Let me help you set that up. Do you have a GitHub repository already created for this project, or should I walk you through creating one?

Do you have a GitHub repository ready for this project?
No, need to create one
Here's how to create a GitHub repository:

Step 1: Create the repo on GitHub

Go to github.com/new
Name it something like dtc-coaching-landing-page
Keep it private (or public if you prefer)
Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push existing code)
Click "Create repository"
Step 2: Let me know the repo URL Once created, share the URL (it'll look like https://github.com/yourusername/dtc-coaching-landing-page)

Then I can help you initialize git and push all the files. You'll need to make sure you have git configured with your GitHub credentials on your machine.

Alternatively, if you'd like, you can:

Download the outputs folder from here
Drag and drop all the files directly into the GitHub repo via the web interface
Which approach works better for you?

Uploaded image
are we good like that?

Yes, that looks perfect! The settings are good:

Repository name: dtc-coaching ✓
Private: ✓ (keeps it secure)
No template, README, .gitignore, or license: ✓ (we'll push existing files)
Go ahead and click "Create repository".

Once it's created, you'll see a page with instructions. Share the repo URL with me (it'll be https://github.com/Decommerce/dtc-coaching) and I'll help you push all the files.

https://github.com/Decommerce/dtc-coaching.git

The repo is created. Now let me help you push all the files. Since I don't have direct access to your local machine's git, here's the easiest way to do it:

Option 1: Upload directly via GitHub web (quickest)

Go to https://github.com/Decommerce/dtc-coaching
Click "uploading an existing file" link on the page
Drag and drop these files/folders from your outputs folder:
decommerce-landing-page.html
logos/ folder (with all logo files)
images/ folder (with all founder photos)
Click "Commit changes"
Option 2: Use git commands

If you prefer command line, open Terminal and run:

bash
cd ~/Downloads  # or wherever your outputs folder is
git clone https://github.com/Decommerce/dtc-coaching.git
cd dtc-coaching
# Copy your files into this folder, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Initial landing page"
git push origin main
Which option works better for you? Once the files are in GitHub, we can connect it to Vercel for automatic deployments.

Add your custom domain (e.g., coaching.decommerce.com)
Add the DNS records Vercel provides to your domain registrar
That's it! Vercel will automatically redeploy whenever you push changes to GitHub.

Let me know once you've connected it and I can help with the custom domain setup if needed.

I don't really want to pay for vercel yet... so I ened to change the visibility

Yes, exactly! The issue is that Vercel's free tier doesn't support private GitHub organization repos. You have two options:

Option 1: Make the GitHub repo public

Go to https://github.com/Decommerce/dtc-coaching
Click Settings (top right)
Scroll down to Danger Zone
Click Change visibility → Make it Public
Then go back to Vercel and it should work on the free plan
Option 2: Use Netlify instead Netlify's free tier does support private repos from organizations.

I'd recommend Option 1 since it's just a landing page with no sensitive code. Making it public is fine and quite common for marketing sites.

What settings should I use

The settings look good! Just keep them as they are:

Framework Preset: Other ✓ (it's a static HTML site)
Root Directory: ./ ✓ (correct, files are at the root)
You don't need to change anything in "Build and Output Settings" or "Environment Variables".

Just click Deploy and Vercel will deploy your site. It'll be live in about 30 seconds!

it looks that there is an error

The deployment worked, but Vercel is showing a 404 because it's looking for an index.html file and your file is named decommerce-landing-page.html.

You need to rename the HTML file to index.html in your GitHub repo:

Go to https://github.com/Decommerce/dtc-coaching
Click on decommerce-landing-page.html
Click the pencil icon (Edit) in the top right
Click on the filename at the top and rename it to index.html
Scroll down and click Commit changes
Vercel will automatically redeploy, and your site should work at dtc-coaching.vercel.app within a minute or two.

Vercel will automatically detect the change and redeploy your site. Give it about 30-60 seconds, then visit dtc-coaching.vercel.app and it should work!

How cna I manually redeploy th enew comit

In Vercel, go to your project dashboard and click on Deployments in the top menu. Then click the three dots (...) next to the latest deployment and select Redeploy.

Or it might have already auto-deployed! Check if there's a new deployment in the list. Vercel usually picks up GitHub commits automatically within a minute or two.

You can also just visit your site at dtc-coaching.vercel.app to see if it's working now.

it doesn't look like the leads form the popup are getting saved in the google sheet

Let me check if there's an issue with the Google Apps Script. The script might need some adjustments for CORS handling.

Can you try testing it by:

Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IkdCWzMDqTQ8N6yWjy8pwjvst7B-TOl5FSIhMkAYHKk/edit
Go to Extensions → Apps Script
Make sure the code looks like this:
javascript
function doPost(e) {
  try {
    var data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
    
    var spreadsheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById('1IkdCWzMDqTQ8N6yWjy8pwjvst7B-TOl5FSIhMkAYHKk');
    var sheet = spreadsheet.getActiveSheet();
    
    // Check if headers exist
    if (sheet.getRange('A1').getValue() === '') {
      sheet.getRange('A1:E1').setValues([['Timestamp', 'First Name', 'Last Name', 'Email', 'Source']]);
    }
    
    sheet.appendRow([
      data.timestamp || new Date().toISOString(),
      data.firstName || '',
      data.lastName || '',
      data.email || '',
      data.source || 'website'
    ]);
    
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({'result': 'success'}))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
      
  } catch (error) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({'result': 'error', 'error': error.toString()}))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  }
}

function doGet(e) {
  return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({'status': 'active'}))
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
}
After updating, click Deploy → Manage deployments
Click the pencil icon to edit
Change "Version" to New version
Click Deploy
This will create a new deployment. Did you also make sure to set "Who has access" to Anyone when you deployed?

do we need to update the URLS?

Yes! The URL in your Apps Script deployment is different from what's in the landing page.

The new URL from your screenshot is: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxk-l44fPEXfXUgR2qttY913MqNIS1WKUSIo1b5F_8v_bj0TaaE6MeE1YDsWk...

But it looks like it might be truncated. Can you click Copy next to the Web app URL and share the full URL with me?

Also, one important thing to check: when you deployed, did you set "Who has access" to "Anyone"? That's required for the form to work from your website.

I've received this feedback "Thinking out loud: the difference of what we do vs. an agency isn't clear to me upfront. Should we mention that we are sparring partners, helping them ask the right questions, accelerate faster, and make the most of their existing resources.'We're Roy and Allan, founders who scaled a DTC brand from $0 to $3M+ in 2 years, shipped to 120 countries, built our own e-commerce software, and now work with founders who want their growth engine to actually work.We're not an agency. We're founders who work with founders.'--> not super clear what our product is here"

Review th epage and give me your critical poitn of view

I've reviewed the page and here's my critical assessment:

The Core Problem: What You Actually Do is Buried

The hero section talks about who you are (founders who scaled TBô) but not what you actually offer. The visitor has to scroll past the video, social proof, and the entire "problem" section before they finally understand you're offering coaching/sparring partnerships.

Specific Issues:

Hero subtitle is vague: "We're founders who work with founders" sounds nice but says nothing. Work with them how? Doing what?
No clear value proposition up front: The first thing visitors see is their problem ("Your DTC channel should be a machine"). Good. But then you jump to your credentials instead of your solution.
"We're not an agency" is defensive: You're defining yourself by what you're NOT before explaining what you ARE. This creates confusion.
The pricing section is the first clear explanation: It's not until someone scrolls 80% down the page that they see "Two Strategy Calls per Month" and "Direct Slack Access." That's way too late.
My Recommendation:

Rewrite the hero to immediately clarify the offer. Something like:

"Your DTC channel should be a machine by now."

"We help 7-figure DTC founders cut through the noise with strategic sparring, not more agency retainers. Two calls a month. Direct Slack access. Real accountability."

Then follow with your credentials (TBô, $3M, 120 countries) as proof you can deliver.

Other Observations:

The "What Working Together Actually Looks Like" section is strong but comes too late
"Founders for Founders" section repeats the same message without adding clarity
The pricing options ($4,500/mo vs $10,000 one-time) are clear but feel disconnected from everything above
Want me to draft revised hero copy that makes the offer clearer upfront?

Can you make a copy of the current landign page and add these optimisations?

I'll create a copy of the landing page with the optimizations to make the offer clearer upfront.

Let me read the rest of the file and then create the optimized version:

Now I have enough context. Let me create the v2 version with an optimized hero section that makes the offer clearer upfront:


View steps
Good, the v2 file was created. Now let me update the hero section to make the offer clearer upfront:


View steps
Now let me also update the "Founders for Founders" section to better clarify the offer:


View steps
Now let me update the meta description to match the clearer positioning:


View steps
I've created the optimized v2 version of your landing page. Here's a summary of the key changes:

Key Optimizations in V2:

Hero subtitle now explains the offer immediately:
Before: "Instead, it's still not moving at the pace you want..."
After: "We help 7-figure DTC founders cut through the noise with strategic sparring. Not more agency retainers. Two calls a month. Direct Slack access. Real accountability."
Removed redundant copy - Cut the "hero-description" paragraph about CAC/repeat rate (moved concept to Problem section) and the vague tagline.
Founders section reframed as "What We Actually Do":
Before: "Founders for Founders" / "We're not an agency"
After: "What We Actually Do" / "Strategic sparring for DTC founders. Not execution. Not retainers."
Bullet points now action-focused:
Challenge assumptions before they get expensive
Help hold agencies accountable
Accelerate decisions with real-time insights
Updated meta description to match the clearer positioning.
What stays the same: All the detailed sections (pricing, how it works, testimonials) remain intact since they provide the depth once the visitor is hooked.

These are great images showing Roy speaking at conferences, on panels, and backstage at TEDx. I'll add these to the landing page in strategic places to build credibility. Let me update the v2 file:

DMEXCO presentation - Perfect for the "Why Us" section

"We help 7-figure DTC founders cut through the noise with strategic sparring. Not more agency retainers. Two calls a month. Direct Slack access. Real accountability."
"Not more agency retainers." --> what does this mean?

Also don't use the same image twice

You're right, that phrase is confusing. "Not more agency retainers" was meant to differentiate you from agencies, but it reads awkwardly and doesn't make sense on its own.

Let me fix both issues:

This is more this part that we should change.

let's keep this part as is: "Your DTC channel should be a machine by now.

"two calls a month, direct Slack access,".. i think we don't have to say that here already

Good feedback! Let me update that paragraph - removing the specific details and changing to "ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders":


1 step
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

**Context from previous session**: The conversation started with a summary of previous work creating a DTC founder coaching landing page for Decommerce. Key elements included:
Landing page with Meta Pixel tracking
Exit-intent popup for newsletter signup
Google Apps Script integration for form submissions
YouTube video embedding
Founder photo collage
Multiple logo and responsive design fixes

**Exit-intent popup implementation**: Added popup with Google Apps Script URL, needed to fix the URL format from /a/macros/decommerce.com/ to /macros/s/.

**Em dash removal**: User requested removal of all "—" characters from the copy.

**Deployment discussion**: 
Discussed GitHub and Vercel deployment
Created GitHub repo at Decommerce/dtc-coaching
Had to make repo public for free Vercel tier
Renamed file to index.html for Vercel

**Google Sheets form issue**: Forms weren't saving - had to update the Google Apps Script URL in the landing page.

**Landing page feedback and V2 creation**:
User received feedback that the offer wasn't clear upfront
Created decommerce-landing-page-v2.html with optimizations
Updated hero section, founders section
Added new images (DMEXCO, DTCx, eTail Connect, TEDx)

**Recent changes to V2**:
Fixed confusing "Not more agency retainers" phrase
Removed duplicate images
User wanted to keep original hero subtitle
Changed "Roy and Allan" paragraph to clarify the offer
Latest feedback: use "ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders" and remove "two calls a month, direct Slack access" details

**Current pending edit**: The last edit to update the hero-founders paragraph failed because the file wasn't read first. This needs to be completed.

- Images folder with new speaking/event photos

User messages to capture:
1. Discussion about deployment and GitHub
2. Google Sheets integration issues
3. Copy feedback about clarity
4. Specific feedback about em dashes, duplicate images
5. Latest: change to "ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders" and remove specific details

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user is building a VSL landing page for DTC founder coaching (Decommerce). After initial deployment, they received feedback that the offer wasn't clear enough upfront. They wanted:
   - A V2 version of the landing page with clearer messaging about what they actually offer
   - New speaking/event images added to make the page more dynamic
   - Copy refinements to better explain the "strategic sparring" service
   - Target audience expanded to "ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders" (not just DTC founders)
   - The specific details (two calls a month, Slack access) should NOT be in the hero section

Key Technical Concepts:
Vercel deployment from GitHub (free tier requires public repos for organizations)
Google Apps Script Web App for form submissions to Google Sheets
Exit-intent popup with JavaScript mouse leave detection
Meta Pixel tracking with Lead events
CSS Grid for image galleries and photo collages
Responsive design with mobile breakpoints

Errors and fixes:
**"Not more agency retainers" confusing**: User asked what this meant - removed it and rewrote the subtitle
**Duplicate images**: User pointed out same images used twice - reorganized so each image only appears once
**Hero subtitle change was wrong**: User wanted to keep original "Instead, it's still not moving..." - reverted it
**File not read error**: Last edit failed because file wasn't read first - needs to be re-done

Problem Solving:
Solved: Clarified the offer by restructuring the hero section
Solved: Added visual credibility with speaking event photos
Solved: Removed duplicate images across sections
Ongoing: Final copy refinement for the "Roy and Allan" paragraph

All user messages:
"it doesn't look like the leads form the popup are getting saved in the google sheet"
Shared Google Apps Script URL for deployment
"Will I be able to have a custom domain with a free vercel account?"
"But first lets add it into my github"
Shared GitHub repo URL and deployment screenshots
Shared feedback about page clarity: "the difference of what we do vs. an agency isn't clear to me upfront"
"Can you make a copy of the current landign page and add these optimisations?"
"I've added these image in the folder. let's use them to make the ladnign page a bit more alive"
"'Not more agency retainers.' --> what does this mean? Also don't use the same image twice"
"let's keep this part as is: 'Your DTC channel should be a machine by now. Instead, it's still not moving at the pace you want...'"
Screenshot showing Roy's feedback: "I think that's nice. I would say 'ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders' So it's also for ecom people inside of larger brands"
"'two calls a month, direct Slack access,'.. i think we don't have to say that here already"

Pending Tasks:
Complete the edit to the hero-founders paragraph in V2 (change to "ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders" and remove specific service details)
Update GitHub repo with V2 changes when ready
Potentially redeploy to Vercel

Current Work:
Working on updating the hero-founders paragraph in decommerce-landing-page-v2.html. The last attempted edit failed with "File has not been read yet" error.

We help you ask the right questions, challenge your assumptions, and get more from the agencies and resources you already have.</p>

Optional Next Step:
Read the v2 file and complete the pending edit to change "DTC founders" to "ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders" and remove "two calls a month, direct Slack access, and real accountability" from the hero-founders paragraph.

User's exact feedback: "I would say 'ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders'" and "'two calls a month, direct Slack access,'.. i think we don't have to say that here already"

If you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /sessions/amazing-relaxed-fermi/mnt/.claude/projects/-sessions-amazing-relaxed-fermi/f773ef3e-6136-45cb-a319-ea6288b95aef.jsonl
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

I'll continue with the pending edit to update the hero-founders paragraph in the V2 landing page. Let me first read the file and then make the change.

I found the line that needs to be updated. Now I'll make the edit to change "DTC founders" to "ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders" and remove the "two calls a month, direct Slack access, and real accountability" detail.

Now I can make the edit:


View steps
Done! I've updated the hero-founders paragraph in the V2 landing page with Roy's feedback:

Changes made:

Changed "strategic sparring for DTC founders" → "strategic sparring for ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders"
Removed the specific details "two calls a month, direct Slack access, and real accountability"
The paragraph now reads:

We're Roy and Allan, founders who scaled TBô from $0 to $3M+ in 2 years. We offer strategic sparring for ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders. We help you ask the right questions, challenge your assumptions, and get more from the agencies and resources you already have.

This keeps the copy cleaner in the hero section and broadens the target audience to include e-commerce leaders within larger brands, as Roy suggested. You can view the updated file:

I'll update the hero-founders paragraph with Roy's feedback:


View steps
Done! Updated with Roy's feedback:

Changes made:

"founders who scaled" → "DTC founders who scaled" (emphasizes they're DTC founders themselves)
"We offer strategic sparring for ambitious DTC founders and e-commerce leaders" → "We work with 2-3 selected DTC founders and e-commerce leaders at a time" (shows scarcity)
Removed "already" from the last sentence ("resources you already have" → "resources you have")
The paragraph now reads:

We're Roy and Allan, DTC founders who scaled TBô from $0 to $3M+ in 2 years. We work with 2-3 selected DTC founders and e-commerce leaders at a time. We help you ask the right questions, challenge your assumptions, and get more from the agencies and resources you have.

Update the "We're roy & allan..." part with this new copy "We're Roy and Allan. We took our DTC brand TBô from $0 to $3M+ in 2 years and have delivered results for global brands. Now we work with 2-3 DTC founders and e-commerce leaders at a time - helping you ask sharper questions, challenge your blind spots, and get more from the agencies and resources you're already paying for."

how should we update this in github?

To update the GitHub repo with your V2 changes, you have a few options:

Option 1: Replace the current index.html with V2 If V2 is ready to go live, you can replace the content of index.html in your repo with the V2 version. This will automatically deploy to Vercel.

Option 2: Add V2 as a separate file Keep the original and add V2 as a new file (e.g., v2.html) so you can A/B test or review both.

Option 3: Create a branch Create a new branch for V2, which lets you preview it on Vercel before merging to main.

Which approach would you prefer? If you want, I can help you push the changes - you'd just need to either:

Give me access to your repo via the folder selector, or
Copy the updated file manually to your local repo and push
Would you like me to walk you through the git commands, or do you have the repo cloned locally?

option 1

I can walk you through the git commands. Do you have the repo cloned locally on your computer?

If yes, here's what you'd do:

Copy the content from decommerce-landing-page-v2.html and replace index.html in your local repo
Then run:
bash
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update landing page with V2 - clearer messaging and new copy"
git push
Vercel will automatically redeploy once you push.

Alternatively, if you want me to do it directly, you can select your local GitHub repo folder using the folder picker (the folder icon in the bottom left). Once you give me access to the folder where your dtc-coaching repo is cloned, I can make the changes and push for you.

Which would you prefer - do it yourself with the commands above, or select the folder so I can help directly?
